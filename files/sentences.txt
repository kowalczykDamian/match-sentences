Will you make a decision?
Will you make up your mind?
Why are you so stressed?
Why are you so wound up?
I didn't go to bed last night.
I stayed up last night.
I had to do my unfinished work.
I had to catch up on my work.
What can we do to reduce your stress?
What can we do to calm you down?
Do you feel like a short walk?
Are you up for a short walk?
Let's end this party.
Let's wind down this party.
Please make yourself happy now.
Please cheer up now.
